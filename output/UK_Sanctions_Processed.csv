(UK Statement of Reasons):The Iranian Cyber Police, founded in January 2011, is a unit of the Islamic Republic of Iran Police, which at the time of its inception until early 2015 was headed by Esmail Ahmadi-Moqaddam (listed). Ahmadi-Moqaddam underlined that the Cyber Police would take on anti-revolutionary and dissident groups who used internet-based social networks in 2009 to trigger protests against the re-election of President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad. In January 2012, the Cyber Police issued new guidelines for internet cafés, requiring users to provide personal information that would be kept by café owners for six months, as well as a record of the websites they visited. The rules also require café owners to install closed-circuit television cameras and maintain the recordings for six months. These new rules may create a logbook that authorities can use to track down activists or whoever is deemed a threat to national security. In June 2012, Iranian media reported that the Cyber Police would be launching a crackdown on virtual private networks (VPNs). On 30 October 2012, the Cyber Police arrested the blogger Sattar Beheshti without a warrant for ‘actions against national security on social networks and Facebook’. Beheshti had criticised the Iranian government in his blog. Beheshti was found dead in his prison cell on 3 November 2012, and is believed to have been tortured to death by the Cyber Police authorities.

(UK Statement of Reasons):Chief of Staff of the Commander-in-Chief FANB, Deputy Minister of Monitoring and Inspection of Government Administration, and Secretary General of the National Defence Council (SECODENA). José Adelino Ornelas Ferreira has been Second in Command and Chief of Staff of Strategic Command Operations of the Bolivarian National Armed Forces (CEOFANB) since June 2017, having been appointed to the post by Nicolas Maduro. The CEOFANB is the highest point of command in the Venezuelan armed forces. The CEOFANB sets the strategic direction of all strands of the Venezuelan military (Army, Navy, Air Force, and National Guard (GNB)), coordinates them, and implements operations. Since September 2020, Ornelas has been the Chief of the General Staff to the Commander in Chief. There is reliable evidence that the GNB has committed serious human rights violations during Ferreira’s period in charge. A report by OHCHR in 2018 documents incidents of people deprived of their liberty and subjected to cruel, inhuman and degrading treatment and (in many cases possibly) torture, reportedly carried out in part by the GNB.  Some of these incidents occurred in the period that Ferreira has held the position of Commander of the CEOFANB. As a commander of the CEOFANB, and Chief of Staff to the Commander in Chief and Strategic Command Operations, and thus in charge of the GNB, there are reasonable grounds to suspect that Ferreira was involved in those acts. There is reliable evidence that the GNB used excessive force against people in the Pemon territory in February 2019, including killing three people, and carried out extrajudicial killings of an alleged terrorist group in El Junquito, Caracas. As a CEOFANB Commander and Chief of Staff at the time, there are reasonable grounds to suspect that Ferreira was involved in those grave human rights violations. Finally, there is reliable evidence that In May 2019 members of the Venezuelan National Guard (GNB), which sits under the command of the CEOFANB, during Ferreira’s time in role, used tear gas to disperse a march of opposition supporters.  Due to his role, Ferreira is partially responsible for this repression of civil society and violation of freedom of expression. (Gender):Male",1964-12-14,2020-06-30,2020-12-31,2022-08-02

(UK Statement of Reasons):There are reasonable grounds to suspect that Venezuelan Prosecutor Farik Karin Mora Salcedo has engaged in conduct relevant to a listing under the following criteria: (a) natural persons responsible for serious human rights violations or abuses or the repression of civil society and democratic opposition in Venezuela. (b) natural persons whose action, policies or activities otherwise undermine democracy or the rule of law in Venezuela. There is reliable evidence that Mora is directly responsible for issuing the arbitrary arrests of Parliamentarians, with Parliamentary Immunity. There is a considerable amount of diverse evidence reporting Mora as the prosecutor for at least four people with Parliamentary Immunity – Requesens, Borges, Alban, and Marrero, making him responsible by virtue of his position for undermining democracy and the rule of law, and repressing democratic opposition. Mora was the prosecutor for the case of Fernando Alban, where the defendant died under suspicious circumstances. There is reliable evidence that Mora participated in Alban’s autopsy, saw visible signs of torture, and announced an incorrect cause of death to cover this up. According to multiple allegations, some first-hand accounts, he has been witness to the torture of multiple prisoners, some of whom he was prosecutor for. There are thus reasonable grounds to suspect that Mora consented or acquiesced to such acts, and therefore bears responsibility for the serious human rights violation of torture.

He was appointed Vice President of the National Assembly’s Permanent Commission on the Environment in January 2021. Parra Rivero had previously served as a National Assembly Deputy for the period 2016-2020. There are reasonable grounds to suspect that Parra has been involved in undermining democracy in Venezuela by taking office as NA President on 5 January 2020 under an illegitimate process. The evidence indicates that Parra didn’t have the quorum for a session, the session was not moderated by the previous President of the National Assembly and security forces blocked access to MPs that tried to enter the NA to participate in elections for a new National Assembly board. There are also reasonable grounds to suspect that Parra was involved with Operation Alacran, a scandal in which MPs were bribed, intimidated and coerced by the regime (or deputies co-opted by the regime) to not vote for opposition figurehead Juan Guaidó.

(UK Statement of Reasons):Andrei Veniaminovich Yarin is the Chief of the Presidential Domestic Policy Directorate in the Presidential Executive Office. The Presidential Office is a state body providing support for the President’s work and monitoring the implementation of the President’s decisions and overall Governmental policies and most important action. Russian opposition leader Alexey Navalny was the victim of an attempted assassination during his August 2020 visit to Siberia, in which a chemical weapon—a toxic nerve agent of the Novichok group—was used. The activities and movements of Alexey Navalny during his journey to Siberia, from where he intended to return to Moscow on 20th August 2020, were closely monitored by the authorities of the Russian Federation, including the Federal Security Service (FSB). Russia had the technical capability to carry out the attack. The Russian State has previously produced Novichoks and would still be capable of doing so. Within the last decade, Russia has produced and stockpiled small quantities of Novichok. It is unlikely that Novichoks could be made and deployed by non-state actors (e.g. a criminal or terrorist group). Russia had the operational experience to carry out the attack. Russia has a proven record of state-sponsored assassination. It is highly likely that the Russian state was responsible for the attempted assassination of Sergei Skripal in Salisbury in 2018 using a similar type of nerve agent. During the 2000s, Russia commenced a programme to test means of delivering chemical warfare agents, including investigation of ways of delivering nerve agents.

The Presidential Office is a state body within Russia that provides support for the President’s work, monitors the implementation of the President’s decisions, and has responsibility for governmental policy and the regime’s most important actions domestically. Russian opposition leader Alexey Navalny was the victim of an attempted assassination during his August 2020 visit to Siberia, in which a chemical weapon—a toxic nerve agent of the Novichok group—was used. The activities and movements of Alexei Navalny during his journey to Siberia, from where he intended to return to Moscow on 20th August 2020 were closely monitored by the authorities of the Russian Federation. Russia had the technical capability to carry out the attack. The Russian State has previously produced Novichoks and would still be capable of doing so. Within the last decade, Russia has produced and stockpiled small quantities of Novichok. It is unlikely that Novichoks could be made and deployed by non-state actors (e.g. a criminal or terrorist group). Russia had the operational experience to carry out the attack.

It is highly likely that the Russian state was responsible for the attempted assassination of Sergei Skripal in Salisbury in 2018 using a similar type of nerve agent.

Date trust services sanctions imposed: 31/07/2023. (UK Statement of Reasons):State Prosecutor Anna Evgenievna POTYCHKO is an involved person under the Russia (EU Exit) (Sanctions) Regulations 2019. First, POTYCHKO was part of the prosecution team in the criminal proceedings against Vladimir Kara-Murza, appearing in the Moscow City Court for the prosecution on 18 May 2022, arguing against the defence’s appeal from the order of the District Court to keep Kara-Murza in custody during the trial. Kara-Murza was subsequently found guilty of three charges, including disseminating false information about the Russian Armed Forces under part 2 of Article 207.3 of the Russian Criminal Code, one of the so-called “fake news” laws. POTYCHKO was also involved in the criminal proceedings against Ilya Yashin under the same law, and made public comment regarding preventing Yashin from expressing anti-war views to journalists during those proceedings. This law and its application and enforcement by prosecutors and courts is a result of the Russian Government’s policy to prevent the Russian public from knowing the truth about the conflict in Ukraine. This policy prevents the spread of accurate information about the conflict in Ukraine, as well as anti-war sentiment and dissent, which would reduce public support for the war and undermine the Russian Government’s ability to wage the war. In this way, the policy is facilitating the continuation of the war, which is destabilising Ukraine and undermining its territorial integrity and sovereignty. POTYCHKO’s involvement as part of the prosecution team in the criminal proceedings against Kara-Murza, her appearance on behalf of the prosecution to oppose the appeal against preventative detention, and her involvement in and statement regarding the proceedings against Yashin demonstrate that she  is an involved person because she is providing support for a policy that is destabilising Ukraine and undermining its territorial integrity and sovereignty. Second, POTYCHKO is associated with an involved person, namely, Andrey Zadachin. Zadachin was designated by the UK Government on 21 April 2023 for his role as investigator in the criminal proceedings against Kara-Murza. Zadachin and POTYCHKO were both part of the prosecution team for the criminal proceedings against Kara-Murza, and therefore hold, or have held, a professional association.

16595,Individual,Victor Prophane,['Victor Prophane'],[],Haiti,['Haiti'],Haiti,"(UK Sanctions List Ref):HAI0007. (UN Ref):HTi.006. Prophane Victor has long been involved in activities that threaten the peace, security, and stability of Haiti, as well as the entire region. In particular, he has been supporting and arming gangs, trafficking weapons, diverting government revenues, and using violence to secure his political and financial gains.  

 Prophane Victor served in the most recent National Assembly (2016-2020) where he was Member of Parliament (deputé) for Petite Riviere, Artibonite department, an area with increasing levels of violence and gang control. To secure his election as deputé in 2016 and his control over the area, Prophane Victor started arming young men in Petite Riviere who went on to form the Gran Grif gang, currently the main perpetrator of human rights abuses, including sexual violence, in the Artibonite department (see S/2023/674, para 75).  He is no longer a Member of Parliament and is not serving in any political position.     

In addition to securing his political foothold through the use of gangs, Victor is a former senior Customs officer and a businessman who has control over parts of the Customs department, allowing him to build wealth and enabling him to engage in a range of criminal activities with impunity.  According to reporting from January 2023, Victor threatened customs officers in their work.  

Victor continued to support Gran Grif gang until 2020 and has since supported rival gangs in that area (see S/2023/674, para 75).

Luckson Elan, leader of the Gran Grif gang, has long been involved in activities that threaten the peace, security, and stability of Haiti, as well as the entire region.  His gang is the largest and most powerful in the Artibonite Department and has been expanding its territorial control, committing human rights abuses, and trafficking weapons and ammunition. 

On February 8, 2023, members of the Coalition of Jean Denis self-defense group intercepted a vehicle coming from Port-au-Prince which was carrying several crates of arms and ammunition destined for the Gran Grif gang (see OHCHR report, “Criminal Violence Extends beyond Port-au-Prince,” Nov 2023).

Under Elan’s leadership, the human rights abuses and other crimes committed by the gang include extrajudicial killings, rape, recruitment of children, robbery, destruction of property, kidnapping, and hijacking of trucks.  For example, on November 30, 2023, Luckson Elan killed a woman for refusing to have sexual relations with him.  In April 2024, Gran Grif committed attacks on the judiciary by killing two lawyers. 

Between October 2023 and January 2024, Gran Grif committed nine mass kidnappings, including 157 people.  Gran Grif has also committed some of the highest levels of child recruitment in Haiti.
